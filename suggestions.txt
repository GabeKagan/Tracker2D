Suggestions people have made:
- Full fledged reset button (reverting both bugs and tiles to saved data) - definitely will be implemented
- Progress display (A naive one that just displays the amount of updates will be possible, but calculating the length of the song in advance could be difficult and hard to make performant)
- Scroll bars (Where? I definitely want to put them on the menus; the minimap needs to draw a rectangle representing the view field)
-
