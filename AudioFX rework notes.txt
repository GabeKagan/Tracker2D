The plan:

The list of audio effects on a file needs to be represented as an array of objects. Each one should generate a tab or menu box or something in the UI element I design for it that contains all relevant user modifiable effects.

Problems to solve:
- Complicated (Might need a separate file just to prevent confusion!)
- Ballooning save file size and complexity
- Needs good UI to not be confusing
- How to make the application of multiple complicated audio effects to multiple tiles efficient? Extrapolator is (was) a start.

Things to implement (not necessarily in this order):
1. Audio FX editing window, which can possibly be accessed through editing tile props or adding them. The key is that users should be able to add and edit a tile's FX independently of the rest of its data. Could be useful even with just one audio effect at a time
2. Arbitrary length FX chains. Modify playSound to use an array. Possibly prototype the chain code outside of Tracker2D.
3. Representation of FX chains. Some sort of JSON. See an example at the end of the file.
4. String processing to efficiently handle FX lists in file saving/loading.
5. Error trapping to gracefully handle malformed input/output

JSON example (Needs refinement?):
{
    FX: [
    {
        type: "lowpass",
        frequency: 200,
        range: 200,
        gain: 4.0
    },
    {
        type: "hipass",
        frequency: 800,
        range: 50,
        gain: 2.0
    },    
    {
        type: "pitchbend",
        multiplier: 4
    },
    ]
}
