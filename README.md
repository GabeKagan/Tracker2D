# Tracker2D
A music tracker that uses a 2D space metaphor like Simtunes.

This is not even in pre-alpha yet.
Currently, this software uses jQuery 2.1.3 and the Web Audio API. More acknowledgements as I add things.
It also uses XMLHTTPRequest type things, so you won't be able to run it locally unless you have server software like XAMPP set up. Maybe someday I'll find a way to make it work without that.
