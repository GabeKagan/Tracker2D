        <h1>MANUAL FOR TRACKER2D</h1>
        <strong>Press the help button again at any time to close this window.</strong>
        <p id ="invisibleText">Please finish this help file.</p>
        <p>The most basic tutorial follows:</p>
        <ol>
        <li> Select an instrument from the instrument menu. </li>
        <li> The QWERTY row on a standard keyboard represents a Western chromatic scale; press any key there to select a note; plus and minus allow you to adjust your octave. </li>
        <li> When the "PEN" tool is selected (which it is when you first load up the application), clicking on a square will put instructions on the tile based on the parameters on the left. </li>
        <li> Once you have some instructions painted on the screen, press the play button in the lower left to get the bugs moving. Whenever they move over a grey tile, they'll play sounds based on the instructions in the tile. </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>UI FUNCTIONS</h2>
        <p>We need text here!</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>The Field</h2>
        <p>This is literally where the music happens. The way the UI is currently set up, you can see a 30*23 'slice' of the entire field (although this may change if we implement a zoom feature).</p><br>
        <hr>
        <h2>The Left Bar</h2>
        <p>This uses HTML5-based controls. From top to bottom, the following functions are available: <br>
        <strong>Minimap</strong>: This shows a small view of the entire field. Clicking anywhere on it will move your view to a different part of the field. <br>
        (more)
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>The Bottom Bar</h2>  
        <p> This uses jQuery controls and HTML5 Canvas for icons. From left to right: <br>
        <strong>Play/Pause Button</strong>: Changes state when clicked. Clicking it when it shows the play icon will the bugs to move. Clicking it when it shows the pause icon will cause the bugs to stop moving. Please note that attempting to use many other tools will pause playback.<br>
        <strong>Pen</strong>: Click on a tile in the field, and it will put the musical instructions you've selected in the left bar onto that tile.<br>
        <strong>Eraser</strong>: The eraser removes musical instructions from tiles that you click on.<br>

        <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>    
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you have a lot of bugs playing the same notes and instruments, small pitchbends (0.99, 1.01, etc) can help reduce clipping.</li>
            <li>Even after fields larger than 64*64 are implemented, Tracker2D will probably still be pretty small. Experiment with the flow control to see how efficiently you can utilize space!</li> 
        </ul>
        </p>
        <hr>
            <h2>Effect Reference</h2>
            <p>Tracker2D gives you a couple ways to adjust the sound and playback order of tiles. Expand and rephrase this.</p>
            <hr>
        <h2>Audio Effects</h2>
            <p>Keep in mind that it is currently only possible to apply one audio effect to a tile at a time. This may be changed in the future, although it would require significant revision to the audio playback engine.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Bend Pitch</strong>: Multiplies the pitch of a note by a value between 0 and 16. Useful for pushing an instrument beyond its 6 octave range, transposing without changing notes, or creating microtonal music.</li>
            <li><strong>Lowpass</strong>: Removes frequencies above the input value from a sound. Takes values between 0 and 20,000. This filter is applied after any pitch shifting.</li>
            <li><strong>Highpass</strong>: Removes frequencies below the input value from a sound. Takes values between 0 and 20,000. This filter is applied after any pitch shifting, and is generally very similar to lowpass.</li>
            <li><strong>Stop Playback</strong>: Cuts off a sample once a certain percentage of it has played. Takes values between 0 and 100.</li>
            <li><strong>Start From Later</strong>: Causes a sample to play from its middle. Like "Stop Playback", takes values between 0 and 100.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Flow Control Effects</h2>
            <p>These effects do not change the sound of a tile, but they change how bugs interact with the field. Many of them rely on a tile's "pointer" value, which indicates another tile on the map that they point to.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <div class="flowControlImages">
                        <img src="images/north_arrow_overlay.png" alt="Turn North">
                        <img src="images/east_arrow_overlay.png" alt="Turn East">
                        <img src="images/south_arrow_overlay.png" alt="Turn South">
                        <img src="images/west_arrow_overlay.png" alt="Turn West">
                    </div>
                    <strong>Turn Signals</strong>: When a bug passes over this tile, it will turn in the direction indicated. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <div class="flowControlImages">
                    </div>
                    <strong>Counter</strong>: When a bug passes over this tile, the counter's value will decrease by 1. When the counter reaches 0, the tile will turn into the tile it is currently pointing to.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <div class="flowControlImages">
                        <img src="images/incrementer_overlay.png" alt="Incrementer">
                    </div>
                    <strong>Incrementer</strong>: When a bug passes over this tile, the value of the counter in the tile that this tile is pointing to will increase by 1.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <div class="flowControlImages">
                        <img src="images/teleporter_overlay.png" alt="Teleporter">
                    </div>
                    <strong>Teleport</strong>: When a bug passes over this tile, they will be moved (after playing a sound) to the tile that the teleporter tile points to.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <div class="flowControlImages">
                        <img src="images/freeze_overlay.png" alt="Freeze">
                    </div>
                    <strong>Freeze</strong>: When a bug passes over this tile, all playback pauses. This tile is best used to end a song, and to allow a user to manually restart by restoring bug positions if they so desire.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>

                        <img src="images/restore_bugs_button.png" alt="Revert Tile">
                    </div>
                    <strong>Revert</strong>: When a bug passes over this tile, all bugs are moved back to their initial positions stored in memory (which is updated whenever the user presses the "Store Bug Positions" button, whenever they save a file, or whenever they load a file). Playback does not pause. This is best used for looping music.
                </li>
